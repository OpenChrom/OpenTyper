# OpenTyper

The OpenTyper perspective is aimed at MALDI-TOF MS users. Currently it allows to load mass spectras directly and displays a peak list of the selected spectra. Via the save :floppy_disk: buttons you can export to different file formats. To recieve a [Mass-Up compatible .csv](http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/mass-up/manual#datatypesTab) change the delimiter character to `,` in the *CSV MS Converter* preferences.

Some file format converters, such as *Bruker Flex*, filter spectra by default, which you might want to disable under preferences. The profile mass spectrum view can be enabled in the *Mass Selective Detector (MSD)* settings.
